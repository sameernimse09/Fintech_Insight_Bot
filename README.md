# Fintech_Insight_BotðŸ“Š

Fintech Insight Bot is a comprehensive application that combines the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and financial data analysis to provide real-time insights and summarizations. The bot utilizes the OpenAI GPT models, Pinecone for vector storage, and Streamlit for a user-friendly interface, offering functionalities such as article summarization, stock price analysis, and an intelligent Q&A system based on financial articles.

## Features

1. Insight Bot:
  - Processes and indexes financial articles using Pinecone.
  - Enables users to ask questions about processed articles.
  - Retrieves relevant information using embeddings and GPT models.

2. Real-Time Stock Prices:
  - Fetches stock prices using ```yfinance```.
  - Displays market information such as Market Cap, P/E ratio, and sector.
  - Provides related news for selected stocks.

3. News Article Summarizer:
  - Extracts and summarizes news articles from provided URLs.
  - Displays article keywords and summary using NLP techniques.

## Tech Stack

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:
  - LangChain for LLM chaining
  - OpenAI for GPT-based models
  - Pinecone for vector storage
  - Streamlit for the UI
  - ```yfinance``` for stock data
